## Personal Portfolio

I built a personal portfolio website that showcased my skills, projects, and accomplishments as a web developer. I designed an attractive and visually appealing layout that captured visitors' attention. The website included a home page with a captivating headline, a professional photo, and a summary of my skills. There was also an "About Me" section with a detailed background, education, and professional experience.
